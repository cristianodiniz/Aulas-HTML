        The <strong>Boss 429</strong> (also known as the "Boss 9" by enthusiasts) is arguably one of the rarest and most valued muscle cars to date.
        [1] In total there were 1358 original Boss 429s made. <em>The origin of the Boss 429 came about as a result of NASCAR</em>.
        Ford was seeking to develop a Hemi engine that could compete with the famed 426 Hemi from Chrysler in NASCAR's Sprint
        Cup Series (then known as "Grand National Division"). NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 cars
        be fitted with this motor and sold to the general public. After much consideration, it was decided by Ford that the
        Mustang would be the car that would house this new engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Boss 429 engine was derived from the Ford 385 engine. It used four-bolt mains, a forged steel crank and forged steel
        connecting rods. The engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, with a modified Hemi type combustion chamber which
        Ford called "crescent". <del> These heads used the "dry-deck" method, meaning no head gaskets were used.</del> Each cylinder,
        oil passage and water passage had an individual "O" ring style seal to seal it tight. The Boss 429 engine used a
        single Holley four barrel carburetor rated at 735 CFM mounted on an aluminum intake manifold that flowed well for
        its time. 1969 cars featured a hydraulic lifter camshaft while 1970 models got a mechanical lifter camshaft along
        with an improved dual exhaust system though rated power output stayed the same.

        The Mustang's engine compartment was not wide enough to accommodate the massive Boss 429 engine. As a result Ford assigned
        Kar Kraft of Dearborn, <mark> to modify 4 speed Cobra Jet Mustangs to accept the new Boss 429 Engine.</mark> Kar Kraft was a
        Ford exclusive contracted experimental vehicle facility that functioned as Vehicle Engineering for Ford Special Vehicles.
        Kar Kraft had previously developed the first GT40 MKII's and designed and built the GT40 MKIV's, both of which won
        the LeMans 24 Hour Race in France in 1966 & 1967.
    </p>
    <p>
        Production of the Boss <sub>429</sub> began in 1968 at Kar Kraft's new assembly plant in Brighton, Michigan; the cars were transported
        to this plant directly from the Ford Rouge plant. The new, revised, front apron assemblies that accepted the large
        Boss 429 engine had been installed by the Rouge plant as the base vehicles were being built; this produced a stronger
        and cleaner front structure. The reworked front fenders were also installed at the Rouge plant.

        <strong> Next the battery was <em>repositioned to the trunk and a stiff 3/4" <mark>sway bar was added</mark> to rear end to improve handling</em> since
        the car was now nose heavy. </strong>This was the first Mustang ever fitted with a rear sway bar, and it notably handled much
        better than other big-block Mustangs of the time, making it a very capable track car. It came fitted with an 8,000rpm
        tachometer, and AM only radio. <del>In addition, a hole was cut in the hood, and a manually controlled hood scoop was
        added to these cars. Other features included a front spoiler that was shallower than the Boss 302 spoiler, color
        keyed dual racing mirrors, and an engine oil cooler. It was also equipped with a 3.91 ratio rear axle with a "Traction-Lock"
        limited slip differential.</del></p>
